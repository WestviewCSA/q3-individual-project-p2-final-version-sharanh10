What question(s) did you generate that can be better (get to real answers or understanding) by rewording them to be open-ended or closed? 
I think that some of the close ended questions could have been rephrased so that the answers were a bit more specific. Like when I asked if we need to use hashmaps,
there might be a specific answer, like for a specific part of the project.
